## Code Structure
-Please note that the code structure of the website may not be optimal- . As an amateur developer at the time of coding, I did my best to provide a functional user interface, but the code may not be structured in the most efficient manner. That being said, the website is easy to understand and modify, and I am committed to improving my skills and code quality in the future.

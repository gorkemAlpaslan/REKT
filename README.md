## REKT
## Overview
REKT is a website developed for a company that provides information about the company's services and employees. The website provides a functional user interface, although the code structure may not be perfect.

## Code Structure
Please note that the code structure of the website may not be optimal. As an amateur developer at the time of coding, I did my best to provide a functional user interface, but the code may not be structured in the most efficient manner. That being said, the website is easy to understand and modify, and I am committed to improving my skills and code quality in the future.
